# Overview

`vue3-marquee` was born from an internal need for a quick and easy marquee component that I wanted to use in our website homepage. Many of the component libraries that I found were either unmaintained, complex or not compatible with Vue 3. This component should also work for you if you would like to use a marquee component that just works out of the box and is customizable to fit your use case.

In my search for a good marquee component, I found a React library that seemed to do what I wanted so I decided to emulate the component in Vue 3 for anyone to use. The original React library can be found [here](https://www.react-fast-marquee.com/).

With vue3-marquee you have the option of cloning content to remove any empty spaces for marquee elements that don't fit the width of the container. This will allow you to have seamless content that just works

## Installation

Install the `vue3-marquee` package using your favorite package manager. For Vue 3 specific installation, see [Usage with Vue 3](#usage-with-vue-3). For Nuxt specific installation, see [Usage with Nuxt 3](#usage-with-nuxt-3).

```bash
yarn add vue3-marquee@latest
```

```bash
npm install vue3-marquee@latest --save
```

```bash
pnpm add vue3-marquee@latest
```

## Usage with Vue 3

### Register the component

The most common use case is to register the component globally.

```js
// main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import Vue3Marquee from 'vue3-marquee'

createApp(App).use(Vue3Marquee).mount('#app')
```

If you get an error with Typescript, try `use(Vue3Marquee, { name: "Vue3Marquee" })` instead.

If you need to use a custom component name, you can pass it as an option to the plugin.

```ts
app.use(Vue3Marquee, { name: 'MarqueeComponent' }) // use in  your vue template as  <MarqueeComponent />
```

- `name` string (default: `'Vue3Marquee'`) - set custom component name

Alternatively you can also import the component locally in your SFC.

```js
import { Vue3Marquee } from 'vue3-marquee'

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
}
```

### Use the component

You can then use the component in your template as follows:

#### Script Setup

```vue
<template>
  <Vue3Marquee>
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
  </Vue3Marquee>
</template>
```

#### Composition API

```vue
<template>
  <Vue3Marquee>
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
  </Vue3Marquee>
</template>

<script>
import { defineComponent } from 'vue'
import { Vue3Marquee } from 'vue3-marquee'

export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
  setup() {
    return {}
  },
})
</script>
```

#### Options API

```vue
<template>
  <Vue3Marquee>
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
  </Vue3Marquee>
</template>

<script>
import { Vue3Marquee } from 'vue3-marquee'

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
}
</script>
```

---

## Usage with Nuxt 3

### Register the component

1. Create a folder called **`plugins`** at the root of your project.

2. Create a file named **`Vue3Marquee.client.ts`** inside the `plugins` directory.

3. Add the following code to the file;

   ```js
   import Vue3Marquee from 'vue3-marquee'

   export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
     nuxtApp.vueApp.use(Vue3Marquee, { name: 'Vue3Marquee' })
   })
   ```

   ::alert{type="success"}
   âœ¨ Well done!
   This should register a global component that you can call anywhere in your app under the `<Vue3Marquee>` tag. You can also change the name of the component by changing the `name` property in the plugin file.
   ::

### Use the component

Now you can use the component anywhere in your app. Here is an example of how to use it in a page.

::alert{type="warning"}
Using the `<client-only>` tag might be needed to prevent any hydration errors.
::

```html
<template>
  ...

  <Vue3Marquee>
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
  </Vue3Marquee>

  ...
</template>
```

## Migrating from v3 to v4

The v4 release of `vue3-marquee` uses a new build flow with Vite and Esbuild. This new build flow allows better Typescript support. This also removes the need for the `dist/style.css` file. The css is now imported automatically by the library.

Since making this change will break applications that are using the `dist/style.css` file, I have decided to release v4 as a new version of this package. This will allow users to upgrade to v4 at their own pace. v3 will not be receiving any new features or bug fixes.

All the examples and documentation have been updated to use v4. If you are using v3, I recommend upgrading to v4 as soon as possible. It should be a very simple upgrade.

### Upgrading to v4

To upgrade to v4, you will need to uninstall the v3 package and install the v4 package.

```bash
yarn remove vue3-marquee
yarn add vue3-marquee@latest
```

```bash
npm uninstall vue3-marquee
npm install vue3-marquee@latest --save
```

```bash
pnpm remove vue3-marquee
pnpm add vue3-marquee@latest
```

### Removing the `dist/style.css` file

The `dist/style.css` file is no longer needed. You can remove it from your project. The css is now imported automatically by the library.

#### Vue 3

If you are using Vue 3, you can remove the `dist/style.css` import from your `main.js` or `main.ts` file.

#### Nuxt 3

If you are using Nuxt 3, you can remove the `dist/style.css` import from your `app.vue` file.

âœ¨ Well done! Now you can start using `vue3-marquee` in your application.

::

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx nuxi init -t themes/content-wind my-website
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal and you are ready to go ðŸš€

## Usage

This template has some built-in features to make it as easy as possible to create a content-driven website.

### Pages

Create your Markdown pages in the `content/` directory:

```md [content/index.md]
# My title

This first paragraph will be treated as the page meta description.
```

You can overwrite meta tags by using front-matter:

```md [content/index.md]
---
title: 'Custom title'
description: 'Custom meta description'
image: 'Custom image injected as `og:image`'
---

# My title

This first paragraph will be treated as the page meta description.
```

This is done thanks to Nuxt Content's [document-driven mode](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/document-driven) of Nuxt Content.

### Navigation

The navigation is generated from your pages, you can take a look at the [`<AppNavbar>`](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind/blob/main/components/AppNavbar.vue) component to see how it works.

It uses the [Navigation](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/navigation) from Nuxt Content to fetch the navigation object.

To customize the title displayed in the navigation, you can set the `navigation.title` property in the front-matter of your pages:

```md
---
navigation.title: 'Home'
---

# Welcome to my site

With a beautiful description
```

### Theme configuration

You can configure Content Wind global configuration in the `app.config.ts` file:

```ts [signature]
interface AppConfigInput {
  cover?: string // default: '/cover.jpg'
  socials?: {
    twitter?: string
    github?: string
    mastodon?: string
  }
}
```

Example of settings Twitter and GitHub icons in the navbar:

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  socials: {
    twitter: 'Atinux',
    github: 'Atinux/content-wind'
    mastodon: '@atinux@webtoo.ls'
  }
})
```

### Icons

Use any icon from [icones.js.org](https://icones.js.org) with the `<Icon>` component:

```html
<Icon name="ph:music-notes-fill" />
```

You can also use it in your Markdown:

```md
:icon{name="ph:music-notes-fill"}
```

Will result in :icon{name="ph:music-notes-fill"}

Learn more on [nuxt-icon](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/icon) documentation.

### Code Highlight

It supports code highlighting with Shiki and as well as different [VS Code themes](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md#all-themes).

::markdown-block
\`\`\`ts
export default () => 'Hello Content Wind'
\`\`\`
::

Will result in:

```ts
export default () => 'Hello Content Wind'
```

Updating the theme is as simple as editing your `nuxt.config`:

```ts
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    highlight: {
      theme: 'one-dark-pro',
    },
  },
})
```

Learn more in the [Content Code Highlight section](https://content.nuxt.com/get-started/configuration#highlight).

### Vue Components

Add Vue components into the `components/content/` directory and start using them in Markdown.

See the `<MarkdownBlock>` component in [`components/content/MarkdownBlock.vue`](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind/blob/main/.demo/components/content/MarkdownBlock.vue).

By leveraging the [`<ContentSlot>`](https://content.nuxt.com/components/content-slot) component from Nuxt Content, you can use both slots and props in Markdown thanks to the [MDC syntax](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/markdown).
