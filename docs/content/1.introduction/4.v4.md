# Migrating from v3 to v4

The v4 release of `vue3-marquee` uses a new build flow with Vite and Esbuild. This new build flow allows better Typescript support. This also removes the need for the `dist/style.css` file. The css is now imported automatically by the library.

Since making this change will break applications that are using the `dist/style.css` file, I have decided to release v4 as a new version of this package. This will allow users to upgrade to v4 at their own pace. v3 will not be receiving any new features or bug fixes.

All the examples and documentation have been updated to use v4. If you are using v3, I recommend upgrading to v4 as soon as possible. It should be a very simple upgrade.

## Upgrading to v4

To upgrade to v4, you will need to uninstall the v3 package and install the v4 package.

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn remove vue3-marquee
yarn add vue3-marquee@latest
```

```bash [npm]
npm uninstall vue3-marquee
npm install vue3-marquee@latest --save
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm remove vue3-marquee
pnpm add vue3-marquee@latest
```

## Removing the `dist/style.css` file

The `dist/style.css` file is no longer needed. You can remove it from your project. The css is now imported automatically by the library.

### Vue 3

If you are using Vue 3, you can remove the `dist/style.css` import from your `main.js` or `main.ts` file.

### Nuxt 3

If you are using Nuxt 3, you can remove the `dist/style.css` import from your `app.vue` file.
