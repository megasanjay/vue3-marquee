# Usage with Nuxt 3

::alert{type="warning"}
If you are upgrading from v3 to v4, please remove the `dist/style.css` import from your `app.vue` file. This css is now imported automatically by the plugin.
::

## Register the component

1. Create a folder called **`plugins`** at the root of your project.

2. Create a file named **`Vue3Marquee.client.ts`** inside the `plugins` directory.

3. Add the following code to the file;

   ```js
   import Vue3Marquee from 'vue3-marquee'

   export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
     nuxtApp.vueApp.use(Vue3Marquee, { name: 'Vue3Marquee' })
   })
   ```

   ::alert{type="success"}
   ✨ Well done!
   This should register a global component that you can call anywhere in your app under the `<Vue3Marquee>` tag. You can also change the name of the component by changing the `name` property in the plugin file.
   ::

## Use the component

Now you can use the component anywhere in your app. Here is an example of how to use it in a page.

::alert{type="warning"}
Using the `<client-only>` tag might be needed to prevent any hydration errors.
::

```html
<template>
  ...

  <Vue3Marquee>
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
  </Vue3Marquee>

  ...
</template>
```
